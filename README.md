# Terminal-AI

Welcome to the Terminal-AI branch of the OpenAI Python Scripts repository. This branch contains a Python script and an app that launches the script. The python script engages in a conversation with OpenAI and saves the conversation as a text file just like OpenAI for Pythonista but this works for desktop.

## Overview

The `Terminal-AI` script allows users to chat with OpenAI and saves the entire conversation to a text file. This can be useful for keeping records of interactions or for later reference. There is also a desktop shortcut for linux that launches the python script. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and switch to the `ConversationSaver` branch:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenAI-Python-Scripts.git
   cd OpenAI-Python-Scripts
   git checkout ConversationSaver
